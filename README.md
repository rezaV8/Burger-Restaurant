# Burger-Restaurant
In this project I tried to use all the principles of object oriented programming especially composition and inheritance.
In this project users can oreder a burger with side and drink, also they can add toppings to their burger and the price will change based on the topping.
For the burger users can add up to 3 toppings, for the delux burger they can add up to 2 toppings. Delux burger has a set price so if users add the 2 toppings
to the delux burger the price will not change. Also our regular hamburger meal contains of a regular burger, a small coke and fries.
The drink has a type,price and size and the price will change based on the size of the drink.
The side has a type and a price based on the type.
